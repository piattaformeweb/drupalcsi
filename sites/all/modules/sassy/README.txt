# Installation

Download Libraries, Prepro and Sassy, and place them in your modules folder:
http://drupal.org/project/libraries
http://drupal.org/project/prepro

Download PHPSass, and extract into your sites/all/libraries folder:
http://github.com/richthegeek/phpsass
 - from the link above or just download it directly from here: https://github.com/richthegeek/phpsass/archive/master.zip
