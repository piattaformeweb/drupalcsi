EU Cookie Compliance 7.x - 1.x
==============================
This module intends to deal with the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic
Communications that comes into effect on 26th May 2012.
From that date, if you are not compliant or visibly working towards compliance,
you run the risk of enforcement action, which can include a fine of up to
half a million pounds for a serious breach.

How it works.
=============
The module displays a banner at the bottom or at the top of web site to make
users aware of the fact that cookies are being set. The user may then give
his/her consent or move to a page that provides more details. Consent is given
by user pressing the agree buttons or by continuing browsing the web site. Once
consent is given another banner appears with a thank you message.

The module provides a settings page where the banner can be customised. There
are also template files for the banners that can be overridden by your theme.

Upgrade info.
=============
7.24 introduces a dependency on ctools. Please (install and) enable ctools when
you upgrade from a version below 7.24.

For translations, 7.15 introduced a soft dependency on i18n_variable. If you
need to translate the banners, download i18n and install the i18n_variable and
its dependencies.

https://www.drupal.org/project/i18n

Installation.
=============
1. Unzip the files to the "sites/all/modules" directory and enable the module.

2. If desired, give the administer EU Cookie Compliance banner permissions that
   allow users of certain roles access the administration page. You can do so on
   the admin/user/permissions page.

   - there is also a 'display EU Cookie Compliance banner' permission that helps
   you show the banner to the roles you desire

3. You may want to create a page that would explain how your site uses cookies.
   Alternatively, if you have a privacy policy, you can link the banner to that
   page (see next step).

4. Go to the admin/config/system/eu-cookie-compliance page to configure and
   enable the banner

5. If you want to customise the banner background and text color, either type
   in the hex values or simply install 
   http://drupal.org/project/jquery_colorpicker

6. If you want to theme your banner override the themes in the template file.

7. If you want to show the message in EU countries only, install the geoip
   module: http://drupal.org/project/geoip or the smart_ip module:
   http://drupal.org/project/smart_ip and enable the option "Only display banner
   in EU countries" on the admin page. There is a JavaScript based option
   available for sites that use Varnish (or other caching strategies). The
   JavaScript based variant also works for visitors that bypass Varnish.

Translations.
=============

To translate the message in the banners, enable the "i18n_variable" submodule in
the i18n project.

https://www.drupal.org/project/i18n

After enabling "EU Cookie Compliance" at admin/config/regional/i18n/variable,
you will be able to set your translations on the settings page for this module.

Using Domain Access? Instead of using the "domain_settings" module, you need to
use the "domain_variable_i18n" sub-module from the domain_variable project,
or you won't be able to translate the module settings.

https://www.drupal.org/project/domain_variable

For developers.
===============
If you want to conditionally set cookies in your module, there is a javascript
function provided that returns TRUE if the current user has given his consent:

Drupal.eu_cookie_compliance.hasAgreed()
